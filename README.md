The final project for this class, N215, was a summary of what we have been doing the whole semester. For this assignment I was given a design document (Adobe XD file), similar to the one that was given that we based the homework off of, and had to translate the design into a funcioning one page website with responsive design. This project makes use of JavaScript, JQuery, html, and scss with its various funtions that help in designing css code. The JavaScript/JQuery side of the project uses an MVC design that stores page contents in variables that are called based on the links that are clicked. The scss part is made up of various subforlders of pages and scss files that make use of mixins, scss variables, fonts, and media queries to create a responsive website that looks just like the design document.
