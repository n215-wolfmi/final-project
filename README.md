For this website, I was given a design document (Adobe XD file) and had to translate the design into a funcioning one page website with responsive design. This project makes use of JavaScript, JQuery, html, and SCSS. The JavaScript/JQuery side of the project uses an MVC design that stores page contents in variables that are called based on the links that are clicked. The scss part is made up of various subfolders of pages and scss files that make use of mixins, scss variables, fonts, and media queries to create a responsive website that looks just like the design document.
